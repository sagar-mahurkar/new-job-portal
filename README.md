# PHASE-WISE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## Phase 3: Job Posting (Recruiter side)

🎯 Build your FIRST real feature

Build order (VERY IMPORTANT)

- job.entity.ts

- job.dto.ts

- job.repository.ts

- job.service.ts

- job.controller.ts

- job.routes.ts

Recruiter only.

Rules:

- Service checks ownership

- Repository never checks role

- Controller never checks DB

APIs

- create job

- list my jobs

- get job by id
