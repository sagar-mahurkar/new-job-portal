# PHASE-WISE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## Phase 2: Authorization & Middleware

🎯 Goal

Protect the system before adding features.

Build

- auth.middleware.ts (JWT)

- role.middleware.ts (recruiter / candidate)

Test

- Recruiter cannot access candidate APIs

- Candidate cannot create jobs

🚨 Never add features before this.
